# Python Open Network Simulator (PyONS)

The package provides the kernel for discrete-event simulations in Python 3 language.

It is designed to be suitable for various tasks in mind, while the first objective is 
to simulate networks and queueing systems.

It is my project for master thesis in MIPT. Now it is my present work for PhD thesis.

## Working in development mode

To install this project, simply use the following:

> $ python setup.py develop

From this on, the package will be seen from anywhere on the local machine. When finished, launch:

> $ python setup.py develop --uninstall
